Car Ride Word Duel: A Nostalgia Trip
Remember those long car rides where my brother and I would try anything to keep boredom at bay? Well, I've turned our favorite word game into a digital showdown!

How to play:

Two kids, two words, one epic backseat battle
Player 1 shouts "molar" (Q key), Player 2 yells "porthole" (P key)
Sneak in your word: 1 point. Interrupt your sibling: 3 points!
First to 30 points wins and gets imaginary shotgun for life

Tech stuff (for the curious parents):

Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no backseat drivers needed)
Custom SVG graphics that'll make you feel like you're really there
Speech bubbles pop up faster than a "Are we there yet?"
Scores tucked in the bottom corners, victory dance in the middle
No cheating! Holding down keys is as effective as pressing the imaginary brake

This game captures the essence of our childhood road trips - quick reflexes,
sibling rivalry, and the art of annoying each other just enough without getting
grounded. Perfect for reliving those memories or creating new ones with your own
kids. Just remember: no actual shouting in real cars, please!
